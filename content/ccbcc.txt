CC BCC:

1. Every email needs an address to be sent to, but many clients
   offer additional options, such as CC and BCC - Carbon Copy and
   Blind Carbon Copy.
   <cc_bcc_1>
   
2. These fields lets you send an email to multiple people at once, 
   with the blind carbon copy allowing you to send the additional 
   copies in secret. 
   
   That is, the recipients of a message will see any additional 
   people listed under CC, but not under BCC.
