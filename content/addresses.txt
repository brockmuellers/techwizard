Email Addresses:

1. An email address is similar to your home address, it lets 
   others communicate with you by sending messages to your 
   virtual/online address. 

2. An email address consists of two parts, a person's chosen
   username and the website that manages their email.
   
   They are formatted as username@website, and this is always
   the same.
   
3. The first part, the username, is free for you to choose, many people
   use their first or last names, initials, and birthdate in some 
   combination to try and create a unique identity. Others create usernames 
   that remind them of things they like.
   
   For example, a boy named Marco Farrugia created a couple of the 
   following names:
   
   Mfarrugi, his first initial and most of his last name.
   A.F.Marco, his middle and last initial, followed by his first name.
   Marco, just his first name (this is often already claimed!)
   Marco1998, his name with his birth year at the end, since 'Marco' was already in use.
   
4. The second part, the host name, is the name of the website that
   manages your email, acting as a digital version of the postal service
   that would deliver normal mail.
   
   The host name comes from which website you decide to use to track
   your emails, and the naming portion doesn't mean much beyond that. 
   But the different services offer slightly different features, kind 
   of like how USPS and Fedex aren't exactly the same.   
   
   To continue the example, Marco's username Mfarrugi would look like:
   
   Mfarrugi@gmail.com - Gmail is Google's web mail offering.
   Mfarrugi@msn.com - Microsoft's web mail hosting.
   Mfarrugi@mit.edu - MIT's mail hosting.
   
   Each of the above examples is a valid email address, following the
   username@website format.
