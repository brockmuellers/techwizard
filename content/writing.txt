1. So you've got email all set up and you want to send an email to your friend. Now what?

   Find the button that creates a new message in your email client. Typically, this button says "Compose" or "New email." Here it is in gmail. 
   <email_1>

2. Type the email address of the person you are sending it to in the "To:" field.  
   For now, ignore the cc and bcc fields or read the related explanations for them.
   <email_2>
   
3. In the "Subject:" field, write a short (less than 1 sentence) topic sentence for your email.
   Something like "Thought of you today", "Information for tomorrow's meeting", or "Check out this cool article I read today" will do.
   <email_3>
   
4. Write your email, and make sure you're saying what you meant to. You can add pictures here if you want to.

5. Press send! Your email will be delivered almost instantly. But, don't be surprised if you don't get a reply for quite some time. Some people don't check their email very often, and not every email is seen as needing acknowledgement.
