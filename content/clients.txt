eMail clients:

1.  An eMail client offers a way for you to send and recieve emails, 
    and generally determines the secondary portion of your eMail address.
    Different email clients offer different features, functionality, and 
    aesthetics.

2.  The most commonly used clients work right from your browser, just by
    going to a different website. Others require a download, and end up 
    having more, complex features.

    The next few slides are website-based clients:
    
3.  www.Gmail.com
    <clients_1>
    
4.  www.YahooMail.com
    <clients_2>
    
5.  www.Hotmail.com
    <clients_3>

6.   There are also downloadable clients, but they are much less common:
        Apple Mail
        Windows Outlook
        Mozilla Thunderbird
        
    It's very easy to jusy pick one of the web clients and follow their 
    instructions to make an account and start sending emails!
